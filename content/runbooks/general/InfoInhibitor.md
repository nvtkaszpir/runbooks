# InfoInhibitor

## Meaning

This is an alert that is used to inhibit info alerts.

By themselves, the info-level alerts are sometimes very noisy,
but they are relevant when combined with other alerts.
          
## Impact

## Diagnosis

This alert fires whenever there's a `severity="info"` alert,
and stops firing when another alert with a severity of `warning` or
`critical` starts firing on the same namespace.


## Mitigation

This alert should be routed to a null receiver and configured to inhibit
alerts with `severity="info"`.
